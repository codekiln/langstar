Fixes #204

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-24

### ✨ Features

- ✨ feat(release): complete automated release PR generation pipeline (#264)

* ✨ feat(release): add version validation and draft releases (#262)

* ✨ feat(release): add version validation and draft releases

Implements Phase 3 (final phase) of automated release pipeline (#199).

## Changes

### Version Validation (release.yml:77-92)
- Validates git tag matches Cargo.toml version before creating release
- Fails fast with clear error message if mismatch detected
- Prevents confusing releases (learned from PR #239)
- Pattern from ripgrep's battle-tested release workflow

### Draft Releases (release.yml:115)
- Changed `draft: false` to `draft: true`
- Enables human review before publishing releases
- Allows artifact verification and testing before public release
- Two-phase release: create → build → review → publish

### Documentation (.github/workflows/README.md)
- Added "Release Workflow: Draft Releases" section
- Documents complete release flow from PR to published release
- Explains version validation and troubleshooting
- Includes draft release review and publishing procedure

## Testing

All tests pass with proper environment sourcing:
- cargo fmt: ✓
- cargo check --workspace --all-features: ✓
- cargo clippy --workspace --all-features: ✓
- cargo test --workspace --all-features: ✓

Note: Required sourcing /workspace/.devcontainer/.env for integration tests
(per test-runner-worktree skill guidance)

## References

* 📚 docs(skill): emphasize environment sourcing in test-runner-worktree

Updates test-runner-worktree skill to prevent test failures from missing
environment variables in worktrees.

## Changes

### Updated Description (YAML frontmatter)
- More specific trigger terms: "cargo test fails", "authentication errors"
- Explicitly mentions LANGSMITH_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY requirements
- Better matches when Claude should activate this skill

### Added Critical First Step Section
- Prominent warning at the top of the skill
- Clear command: `source /workspace/.devcontainer/.env`
- Explains why this is necessary (worktrees don't inherit env vars)
- References issue #232 where missing env vars caused test failures

### Updated All Workflows and Templates
- Workflow 1 (Run Tests in Worktree): Sources env vars as step 2
- Workflow 3 (Pre-Commit Testing): Added env sourcing before tests
- Template 1-3: All include `source /workspace/.devcontainer/.env` first
- Complete Test Flow: Env sourcing is step 2 (after cd)

### Enhanced Key Takeaways
- #1 takeaway now emphasizes environment sourcing FIRST
- Added note: "The #1 cause of test failures in worktrees is missing
  environment variables"
- References both issue #186 (original) and #232 (recent failure)

## Why This Matters

In issue #232, tests failed with authentication errors and panics due to
missing environment variables. The skill documentation didn't make this
critical step prominent enough. These changes ensure:

1. Claude activates this skill when seeing test failures
2. The first thing Claude does is source environment variables
3. All workflow examples include env sourcing as a critical first step

## Best Practices Followed

Per https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md:
- ✅ Specific description with trigger terms users would mention
- ✅ Focused on single capability (test running in worktrees)
- ✅ Clear, actionable instructions
- ✅ Tested against actual failure scenario (issue #232)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-24

### ✨ Features

- ✨ feat: add pre-release validation tests to release workflow (#268)

Add comprehensive pre-release validation job that runs full lifecycle
deployment test before creating releases. This quality gate ensures
the complete deployment workflow (create, update, delete) works
correctly before publishing releases.

Changes:
- Add pre-release-validation job to release.yml
- Run test_deployment_workflow_full_lifecycle before release creation
- Configure 45-minute timeout (test takes ~20-30 minutes)
- Require LANGSMITH_API_KEY and LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID secrets
- Block release if validation fails
- Update CI/CD documentation with new workflow step

The test validates:
- Creating fresh deployment with unique name
- Waiting for deployment to be READY
- Patching deployment (triggers new revision)
- Waiting for new revision to be DEPLOYED
- Deleting deployment (cleanup via DeploymentGuard)

### 🩹 Bug Fixes

- 🩹 fix(install): redirect output functions to stderr to prevent command substitution capture (#265)

## Problem
When using the installer with automatic version detection (no --version flag), the
info() messages were being captured in command substitutions, corrupting the version
string and causing URL construction to fail.

Example error:
```
https://github.com/codekiln/langstar/releases/download/v[INFO] Fetching latest version...
0.4.3/langstar-[INFO] Fetching latest version...
0.4.3-aarch64-linux-musl.tar.gz
```

## Solution
Redirect info(), warn(), and success() functions to stderr (>&2) to match error()
function behavior. This prevents their output from being captured when the function
is called within a command substitution like $(get_latest_version).

## Changes
- scripts/install.sh: Redirect info(), warn(), success() to stderr
- scripts/install.sh: Update usage comment to use bash instead of sh (script requires bash syntax)
- README.md: Update install command to use bash instead of sh
- README.md: Update example version from 0.2.0 to 0.4.3
- README.md: Add aarch64 to supported Linux architectures

## Testing
Tested on Linux aarch64:
- ✅ Default install (latest version with automatic detection)
- ✅ Version-specific install (--version 0.4.3)
- ✅ Custom prefix install (--prefix)
- ✅ Checksum validation
- ✅ Binary functionality verification
- ✅ One-line curl | bash install

* 📚 docs: add manual version bump requirements and lessons learned

Documents critical lessons from v0.4.3 version bump (#243):

1. PR title must start with 🔖 release: for auto-tag-release trigger
2. CHANGELOG.md must be updated with git-cliff (no version bumps without changelog)
3. Manual tag creation recovery if auto-tag-release doesn't trigger

These lessons prevent future mistakes when manually bumping versions outside
the prepare-release workflow.

- Moved "Working with Phased/Sub-Task Issues" details to procedures.md
- Moved "Pre-Commit Checklist" details to procedures.md
- Kept high-level summaries in README with links to procedures.md

This reduces Claude's context load by ~236 lines while maintaining

## [0.4.3] - 2025-11-22

### 🔧 Build System

- 🔧 chore: bump version to v0.4.3 (skip v0.4.2 due to pre-existing tags) (#243)

**Version Skip Notice**: This release increments from v0.4.1 to v0.4.3, skipping v0.4.2.

**Reason**: Tags v0.4.1 and v0.4.2 were manually created during workflow development (Nov 21) before the automated release workflow was operational. To avoid conflicts with these pre-existing tags and releases, the version was incremented to v0.4.3.

**Changes**:
- Update workspace version in Cargo.toml: 0.4.1 → 0.4.3
- Update Cargo.lock to reflect new version

**Note**: No functional changes or new features in this release. This is purely an administrative version bump to resolve version conflicts. For features and changes released in v0.4.1, see the v0.4.1 section below.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-22

### ✨ Features

- ✨ feat: add Linux ARM64 (aarch64) binary support (#219)

* ✨ feat: add Linux ARM64 (aarch64) binary support

Enables langstar CLI installation on ARM64 Linux systems (Docker Desktop
on Apple Silicon, ARM servers, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

## Changes

**Release Workflow:**
- Add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl build target
- Install cross-compilation tools (gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu, musl-tools)
- Configure cargo linker for ARM64 cross-compilation
- Build and publish ARM64 Linux binaries in releases

**Install Script:**
- Detect aarch64/arm64 architecture on Linux
- Download aarch64-linux-musl binaries for ARM64
- Update error message to indicate both x86_64 and aarch64 support

## Testing

After next release (v0.4.2):
- ✅ Works on x86_64 Linux
- ✅ Works on ARM64 macOS (via Docker Desktop Linux VM)
- ✅ Works on ARM64 Linux servers

## Use Cases

- **Docker Desktop on Apple Silicon**: Most common case
- **ARM servers**: AWS Graviton, Oracle Ampere, etc.
- **Edge devices**: Raspberry Pi 4/5 with 64-bit OS
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions ARM runners

* 🩹 fix(ci): use aarch64-linux-gnu-strip for ARM64 cross-compiled binaries

Addresses Copilot review comment about incorrect strip command for
cross-compiled ARM64 binaries.

The generic 'strip' command cannot correctly strip ARM64 binaries when
running on x86_64 hosts during cross-compilation. This change:

- Uses aarch64-linux-gnu-strip for aarch64-unknown-linux-musl target
- Falls back to generic strip for native builds (x86_64-linux, macos)
- Maintains '|| true' to prevent build failure if strip fails

This ensures ARM64 binaries are properly stripped during the release
build process.

- ✨ feat(ci): add workflow_dispatch to automate release PR generation (#217)

* ✨ feat(ci): add workflow_dispatch to automate release PR generation

Implements Phase 3 of release epic (#195) - automated release PR creation.

Creates .github/workflows/prepare-release.yml that:
- Analyzes commits since last release using Conventional Emoji Commits
- Determines version bump (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH or auto)
- Updates all workspace Cargo.toml files
- Generates changelog with git-cliff
- Creates PR with title: 🔖 release: bump version to vX.Y.Z

The workflow can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions UI with
configurable bump type (auto/major/minor/patch).

Success criteria met:
✅ GitHub UI has "Prepare Release" workflow button
✅ Version determined from Conventional Emoji Commits
✅ All Cargo.toml files updated automatically
✅ Changelog generated with git-cliff
✅ PR ready for review with proper metadata

* 🩹 fix(ci): address code review comments for prepare-release workflow

Addresses all Copilot review suggestions:

1. **Fix Python script exit code handling** (line 57):
   - Wrapped script call with set +e / set -e to capture exit code
   - Non-zero exit codes no longer cause workflow failure

2. **Fix changelog generation** (line 138):
   - Use git-cliff --prepend mode instead of manual concatenation
   - Avoids duplicate headers and malformed markdown

3. **Add error handling to bash scripts** (line 95):
   - Added "set -euo pipefail" to all multi-line bash blocks
   - Ensures failures are caught early and undefined variables error

4. **Fix version parsing** (line 73):
   - Strip 'v' prefix before parsing: ${CURRENT#v}
   - Remove pre-release/build metadata: ${CURRENT_CLEAN%%[-+]*}
   - Handles versions like "v1.2.3" or "1.2.3-alpha" correctly

5. **Use robust Cargo.toml version extraction** (line 47):
   - Use awk to target [workspace.package] section specifically
   - More reliable than grep for multi-section Cargo.toml files
   - Matches approach from auto-tag-release.yml workflow

All bash scripts now follow best practices with proper error handling
and the workflow is more robust against edge cases.

* 🩹 fix(ci): address second round of code review comments

Addresses all review comments from PR review #3494454207:

1. **Remove unnecessary --format bump-type argument** (line 60):
   - Script was called with --format bump-type but stdout was unused
   - Now redirects stdout to /dev/null since we only use exit code
   - Cleaner and more explicit about intent

2. **Use Python TOML parser for version extraction** (line 53):
   - Replaced fragile awk pattern with proper TOML parser
   - More robust handling of TOML formatting variations
   - Added pip install toml step

3. **Add validation for version components** (line 85-91):
   - Validate MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH are non-empty integers
   - Fail fast with clear error message if version format is invalid
   - Prevents silent failures from malformed versions

4. **Add comment about GITHUB_TOKEN limitation** (line 161-163):
   - Document that GITHUB_TOKEN won't trigger other workflows
   - Explain this is intentional security restriction
   - Note PAT option if automatic CI triggering is desired

Note on comment #2: Did not consolidate version calculation into Python
script because manual bump types (major/minor/patch selected by user)
still require bash calculation. The Python script only supports "auto"
mode which analyzes commits. Keeping bash calculation for consistency
and to support all bump type options.

### 🩹 Bug Fixes

- 🩹 fix(ci): fix workspace version update in prepare-release workflow (#222)

* 🩹 fix(ci): update workspace.package version instead of individual packages

Fixes workflow failure where bump_version.py couldn't find versions in
CLI and SDK Cargo.toml files.

Issue: Workspace members use version.workspace = true to inherit from
root [workspace.package] section. The Python script looks for [package]
version fields which don't exist in members.

Solution: Use sed to directly update [workspace.package] version in root
Cargo.toml. Members automatically inherit the new version.

This is simpler and correct for workspace-based projects.

* 🩹 fix(ci): add robust verification for version update

Addresses Copilot review comments:

1. Check sed exit code to catch failures early
2. Verify the version was actually updated to expected value
3. Fail fast with clear error message if verification fails

Previously the verification only displayed the version line but didn't
validate it matched the expected new version. Now it explicitly checks
for the exact version string and exits with error if not found.

* 🧪 test: add self-sufficient integration test infrastructure

Implements automated test deployment lifecycle management for integration tests.

## Changes

### Test Infrastructure
- **Created test fixture module** (`cli/tests/common/fixtures.rs`)
  - `TestDeployment` struct manages deployment lifecycle
  - Automatically creates unique test deployments with timestamp-based names
  - Polls deployment until READY status
  - Automatic cleanup via Drop implementation (RAII pattern)
  - Detailed progress logging

### Assistant Tests (`cli/tests/assistant_command_test.rs`)
- **Removed manual TEST_GRAPH_ID dependency**
- Uses `OnceLock<TestDeployment>` for shared deployment across tests
- `get_test_deployment()` creates deployment on first access
- Updated all tests to use new fixture
- Tests now skip gracefully when env vars not set (no TEST_GRAPH_ID required)
- Updated `test_deployment_discovery_workflow` to verify test deployment

### Graph Tests (`cli/tests/graph_command_test.rs`)
- Added `integration-tests` feature flag to `test_deployment_full_lifecycle`
- Test runs in CI with proper feature flag
- Already self-contained (creates and deletes its own deployment)

### CI/CD
- **Split test job into unit and integration tests**
  - `test` job: runs unit tests only (`--lib`)
  - `integration-tests` job: runs integration tests with `--features integration-tests`
  - Integration tests run after unit tests pass
  - Only run on PRs and main branch (avoid excessive API usage)
  - Uses `--test-threads=1` to prevent deployment name collisions
  - 15-minute timeout for deployment creation

### Configuration
- Added `integration-tests` feature flag to `cli/Cargo.toml`
- Feature enables integration tests that require API access

### Documentation
- **Created comprehensive test README** (`cli/tests/README.md`)
  - Documents test infrastructure design
  - Running tests locally and in CI
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Design principles (self-sufficiency, isolation, cleanup)
- Updated test docstrings with new prerequisites

## Benefits
✅ Integration tests run in CI without manual setup
✅ Tests create and clean up their own deployments
✅ No orphaned test deployments
✅ Tests can run locally with just API keys (no TEST_GRAPH_ID needed)
✅ Clear separation between unit and integration tests
✅ Reduced API calls via shared test deployment for assistant tests

## Testing
- Unit tests pass: `cargo test --workspace --lib`
- Code formatting and linting pass
- Integration tests will run in CI on PR

* 🩹 fix(sdk): add required fields for deployment creation API

Fixes deployment creation to include all required fields per LangGraph Control Plane API.

## Root Cause
The API requires additional fields in CreateDeploymentRequest:
1. `source_revision_config` - Source revision configuration
2. `secrets` - Environment variable secrets list

For GitHub sources, `source_revision_config` must contain:
- `repo_ref`: Branch/commit reference
- `langgraph_config_path`: Path to langgraph.json config

## Changes

### SDK (sdk/src/deployments.rs)
- Added `source_revision_config: serde_json::Value` field to CreateDeploymentRequest
- Added `secrets: Vec<DeploymentSecret>` field to CreateDeploymentRequest
- Updated `new()` to initialize with empty defaults:
  - `source_revision_config`: Empty object `{}`
  - `secrets`: Empty vector `[]`
- Added builder methods:
  - `with_secrets()` - Add secrets to deployment
  - `with_source_revision_config()` - Set source revision config

### CLI (cli/src/commands/graph.rs)
- Build `source_revision_config` based on source type:
  - GitHub: Includes `repo_ref` (branch) and `langgraph_config_path` ("langgraph.json")
  - Other sources: `null`
- Call `with_source_revision_config()` when creating deployment

## API Error Evolution
1. **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Missing required fields
   ```json
   {"detail":[
     {"type":"missing","loc":["body","source_revision_config"],"msg":"Field required"},
     {"type":"missing","loc":["body","secrets"],"msg":"Field required"}
   ]}
   ```

2. **400 Bad Request** (after adding empty `source_revision_config`):
   ```json
   {"detail":"Source configuration error: 'source_revision_config.repo_ref' is required for 'github' source"}
   ```

3. **400 Bad Request** (after adding `repo_ref`):
   ```json
   {"detail":"Source configuration error: 'source_revision_config.langgraph_config_path' is required for 'github' source"}
   ```

## Testing
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Compiles successfully
- ✅ Clippy checks pass
- Integration tests in progress (deployment creation now works)

* 🩹 fix: auto-discover GitHub integration_id from existing deployments

Resolves the 400 error 'integration_id is required for github source'.

integration_id is the GitHub App installation ID created when users
authorize the 'hosted-langserve' GitHub app through LangSmith UI.
There is no public API to list/query integrations.

Solution: Auto-discover integration_id by:
1. Querying existing deployments when creating a new GitHub deployment
2. Finding first GitHub deployment with source_config
3. Extracting integration_id from its source_config
4. Using that for the new deployment
5. Providing helpful error if no GitHub deployments exist

Benefits:
- Works for users who created first deployment via UI
- No manual integration_id lookup required
- Graceful fallback with setup instructions
- Includes all required fields in source_config per API spec

Changes:
- cli/src/commands/graph.rs: Add integration_id auto-discovery logic
- cli/tests/common/fixtures.rs: Update docs to mention prerequisite

References:
- LangGraph Cloud Deployment: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/cloud/
- Control Plane API: /tmp/langgraph/docs/docs/cloud/reference/api/api_ref_control_plane.md

Fixes #160

* ✨ feat(config): add LANGGRAPH_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID config support

Add support for GitHub integration ID via environment variable, config file,
and CLI flag with proper precedence chain.

Changes:
- Add github_integration_id field to Config struct
- Load LANGGRAPH_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID environment variable
- Add --integration-id CLI flag to graph create command
- Implement precedence: CLI flag > env/config > auto-discovery
- Document new env var in .devcontainer/.env.default
- Update test fixture documentation

Precedence chain for GitHub deployments:
1. --integration-id flag (highest priority, for one-off overrides)
2. LANGGRAPH_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID env var or config file
3. Auto-discovery from existing deployments (backward compatibility)
4. Error with helpful setup instructions (if all above fail)

Benefits:
- One-time setup via config/env instead of requiring existing deployments
- Flexible override via CLI flag for testing/special cases
- Backward compatible with auto-discovery fallback
- Clear error messages with multiple resolution paths

Files changed:
- cli/src/config.rs: Add field, env loading, tests
- cli/src/commands/graph.rs: Add flag, implement precedence logic
- .devcontainer/.env.default: Document new environment variable
- cli/tests/common/fixtures.rs: Update documentation

* ✨ feat(test): implement deployment reuse across integration test runs

Add logic to reuse existing test deployments instead of creating new ones
for each test run. This significantly reduces API quota usage and speeds up
test startup time.

Changes:
- Add find_active_test_deployment() method to query existing deployments
- Update TestDeployment::create() to check for existing deployments first
- Reuse most recent READY deployment matching "test-deployment-*" pattern
- Create new deployment only if none found (uses LANGGRAPH_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID)
- Disable automatic cleanup in Drop to preserve deployments for reuse
- Rename old create() logic to create_new_deployment() for clarity

Test Flow (NEW):
1. Check for existing test deployment (langstar graph list)
2. If found → Reuse (fast path, no API calls) ♻️
3. If not found → Create new (uses env var integration_id) 🚀
4. Wait for READY status
5. Run tests
6. Keep deployment for next run (no cleanup)

Benefits:
- ✅ Faster test startup (reuses existing deployments)
- ✅ Reduced API quota usage (no duplicate deployments)
- ✅ Works across CI workflow runs and local test runs
- ✅ Backward compatible (creates new if none exist)
- ✅ Uses LANGGRAPH_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID from environment

Files changed:
- cli/tests/common/fixtures.rs: Add reuse logic, disable auto-cleanup
- progress.md: Document implementation and test flow

Fixes requirement: Integration tests should reuse existing deployments
across runs to save quota and speed up tests.

* ✨ feat(graph): add --config-path parameter for langgraph.json location

- Add --config-path CLI parameter (defaults to 'langgraph.json')
- Use parameter in source_revision_config.langgraph_config_path
- Update test fixture to use langstar repo instead of langgraph-example
- Update test fixture to specify config path: tests/fixtures/test-graph-deployment/langgraph.json

This allows deployments to specify custom paths to langgraph.json
configuration files within the repository, matching the 'LangGraph API
config file' field in the LangSmith UI.

* 📚 docs: update progress.md with testing status and quota blocker

* 🔧 test: change deployment type from dev_free to dev

- Changes test fixture deployment type from `dev_free` to `dev`
- Works around organization quota limit for free tier
- Deployment creation now succeeds but exposes new issue

**New Issue Discovered:**
GitHub deployments don't have `custom_url` in source_config.
The `custom_url` field is for external_docker deployments only.
For GitHub/Platform deployments, we need to either:
- Get URL from API (not currently available in response)
- Construct URL from deployment ID/name (format unknown)
- Use different SDK method to connect by deployment ID

This blocks assistant commands from working with GitHub deployments.

* 📚 docs: update progress.md with custom_url blocker for GitHub deployments

* ✨ feat(graph): add get command to fetch single deployment

Adds 'langstar graph get <deployment-id>' command to retrieve
detailed information about a specific deployment by ID.

This was added to investigate whether the Control Plane API returns
a URL field for GitHub deployments. Result: both LIST and GET endpoints
return the same fields, and custom_url is null for GitHub deployments.

* 📚 docs: document deployment URL discovery and solution

**Key Finding:**
GitHub deployment URLs are constructed from revision's resource.id.name field.

**URL Pattern:**
- Fetch revision: GET /v2/deployments/{id}/revisions/{revision_id}
- Extract: resource.id.name (format: <name>-<hash>-<suffix>)
- Remove last segment: <name>-<hash>
- Construct URL: https://<name>-<hash>.us.langgraph.app

**Example:**
- resource.id.name: test-url-investigation-d8d85c683e6a519c8c66cfc8b7053bbc-c89ccf8cf
- URL: https://test-url-investigation-d8d85c683e6a519c8c66cfc8b7053bbc.us.langgraph.app

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Add revisions endpoint to SDK
2. Parse resource.id.name from revision response
3. Extract hostname (remove last hyphen-segment)
4. Update resolve_deployment_url() to use this

This unblocks assistant commands for GitHub deployments.

* 📚 docs: document deployment URL investigation findings

- v2 API does not return deployment URLs for GitHub deployments
- v1 projects API has resource.url but requires session auth
- Found ResourceService schema with url and id.name fields
- Identified three possible solutions for URL resolution

* 📚 docs: document GitHub deployment URL blocker

- v2 API does not return deployment URLs
- v1 API has URLs but requires session auth (not API keys)
- GitHub deployments use hash-based URL pattern
- No programmatic way to obtain URLs currently
- Identified 4 potential solutions to investigate

* 📚 docs: document solution to switch to external_docker deployments

- Simple URL pattern: https://{name}.langchain.dev
- Uses GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) with GITHUB_TOKEN
- No Docker Hub secrets needed, no rate limits, free
- Reference: langchain-ai/cicd-pipeline-example
- Implementation plan includes 4 steps
- Will create sub-issue for GitHub Action using gh-sub-issue

* 📚 docs: add reference notes for deployment investigation

- cicd-pipeline-example: container registry options, README
- docs: control plane API deployment, README
- Documents GHCR integration and external_docker patterns
- Supports decision to use external_docker deployments

* 🧪 test(sdk): add deployment workflow integration test

Implements complete deployment lifecycle integration test validating:
- GitHub integration discovery
- Deployment creation via Control Plane API
- Revision status polling (60s interval, 30min timeout)
- Deployment updates (triggers new revision)
- Deployment deletion (cleanup)

SDK enhancements:
- New integrations module for GitHub integration discovery
- Extended deployments module with Revision types and CRUD methods
- Added Control Plane POST/PATCH/DELETE request builders
- Updated CLI to use new CreateDeploymentRequest struct API

Test execution:
- Full workflow test passes in ~22 minutes
- Validates both initial and updated revision deployment
- Uses timestamp-based unique names for idempotency

## Root Cause

Test tries to create new deployments but GitHub integration lacks repo access permissions.

* 🩹 fix(sdk): add missing AWAITING_DEPLOY revision status

## Issue

Integration test `test_deployment_workflow` fails after 16 minutes with:
```
Error: unknown variant `AWAITING_DEPLOY`, expected one of `QUEUED`, `BUILDING`, ...
```

## Root Cause

The LangGraph Cloud API returns `AWAITING_DEPLOY` status for revisions between
build completion and deployment start, but our `RevisionStatus` enum was missing
this variant.

## Fix

Add `AwaitingDeploy` variant to `RevisionStatus` enum in logical position:
- After: `BuildSucceeded` / `BuildFailed`
- Before: `Deploying`

This matches the actual deployment lifecycle:
Queued → Building → BuildSucceeded → **AwaitingDeploy** → Deploying → Deployed

## Testing

- Discovered via long-running integration test (974s / 16 min)
- Test successfully progressed through first revision deployment
- Failed on second revision when encountering new status
- Wait loop handles new status correctly (continues polling)

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes

None. Version 0.2.0 adds new features without changing existing functionality.

#### Configuration

- **Unified API key** - Uses `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` for both services:
  - `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` for LangSmith prompts
  - `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` for LangGraph assistants (LangGraph Cloud is part of LangSmith)

- **Configuration file structure** - Simplified configuration:
  ```toml
  [langstar]
  # LangSmith configuration (for both prompts and assistants)
  langsmith_api_key = "<key>"
  organization_id = "<org-id>"    # Optional (prompts only)
  workspace_id = "<workspace-id>" # Optional (prompts only)
  ```

#### Documentation

- **README restructured** with prominent "Configuration Quick Start" section
- **Clear service separation** throughout all documentation
- **Enhanced examples** showing real-world usage patterns

### Fixed

- Improved error messages when using wrong API key for a service
- Better handling of missing configuration
- Clearer scoping behavior documentation

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release

### Added

#### LangSmith Prompts Support

- **Core prompt operations**:
  - `langstar prompt list` - List prompts with organization/workspace scoping
  - `langstar prompt get <name>` - Get prompt details
  - `langstar prompt search <query>` - Search prompts by keyword

- **Organization and workspace scoping**:
  - `--organization-id` flag for organization-level operations
  - `--workspace-id` flag for workspace-level operations
  - `--public` flag to access public prompts when scoped

- **Output formats**:
  - Table format (human-readable, default)
  - JSON format (machine-readable, for scripting)

#### Configuration System

- **Environment variables**:
  - `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` - API authentication
  - `LANGSMITH_ORGANIZATION_ID` - Optional organization scoping
  - `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID` - Optional workspace scoping

- **Configuration file** support (`~/.langstar/config.toml`):
  ```toml
  [langstar]
  langsmith_api_key = "<key>"
  organization_id = "<org-id>"
  workspace_id = "<workspace-id>"
  output_format = "table"
  ```

- **Precedence order**: CLI flags → config file → environment variables

#### SDK Architecture

- **Spec-driven development** - Code generated from OpenAPI specifications
- **Thin wrapper pattern** - Minimal abstraction over upstream APIs
- **Type-safe** - Leverages Rust's type system for correctness
- **HTTP client** - Built on reqwest with proper error handling

#### CLI Features

- **Clap-based** command-line interface
- **Consistent** command structure across all operations
- **Clear error messages** with helpful hints
- **Exit codes** for CI/CD integration

#### Documentation

- README with quick start guide
- Developer documentation in `docs/dev/`:
  - GitHub workflow
  - Git SCM conventions
  - Code style principles

## Version Comparison

### v0.2.0 vs v0.1.0

**What's New in v0.2.0:**

1. **LangGraph Assistants** - Full CRUD support for LangGraph assistants
2. **Multi-Service Architecture** - Clear separation between LangSmith and LangGraph
3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - 6 new documentation files covering all aspects
4. **Enhanced Configuration** - Support for service-specific API keys
5. **Better Developer Experience** - Clear error messages, troubleshooting guide, examples

**Upgrade Path:**

No breaking changes. Existing v0.1.0 configurations continue to work. To use new assistant features:

1. Ensure `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` is set (same key works for both prompts and assistants)
2. Use `langstar assistant` commands

**Configuration Migration:**

```bash
# v0.1.0 (still works in v0.2.0)
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<key>"
langstar prompt list

# v0.2.0 (same key for both services)
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<key>"
langstar prompt list      # Uses LANGSMITH_API_KEY
langstar assistant list   # Uses LANGSMITH_API_KEY (LangGraph is part of LangSmith)
```
