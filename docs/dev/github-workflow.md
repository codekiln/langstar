# GitHub Issue-Driven Development Workflow

This document outlines the preferred development workflow for the Langstar project, leveraging GitHub issues and Claude Code GitHub Actions for streamlined branch management and pull requests.

## Workflow Overview

The standard development process follows these steps:

1. **Create GitHub Issue** - Document the feature, bug, or task
2. **Branch Creation** - Create or use automated branch creation for the issue
3. **Development** - Implement changes on the issue branch
4. **Pull Request** - Submit a PR referencing the original issue
5. **Review & Merge** - Review, approve, and merge the PR (closes the issue)

## Benefits

- **Traceability**: Every change traces back to an issue for clear context
- **Automation**: Leverage Claude Code's GitHub Actions for streamlined workflows
- **Consistency**: Standardized process across the team
- **History**: Clear audit trail of what was done and why

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Issue

Start by creating a GitHub issue that describes what needs to be done.

### Issue Best Practices

- **Clear title**: Use descriptive titles (e.g., "Add user authentication" vs "Fix bug")
- **Description**: Provide context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Labels**: Apply appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
- **Assignment**: Assign to yourself or relevant team member
- **References**: Link to related issues or PRs using `#issue-number`

### Example Issue

```markdown
## Description
Implement user authentication using JWT tokens

## Requirements
- [ ] Create login endpoint
- [ ] Create registration endpoint
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation
- [ ] Add authentication middleware

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can register with email/password
- Users can login and receive JWT token
- Protected routes require valid JWT token
```

---

## Step 2: Branch Creation

### Branch Naming Convention

Branches should follow this format:

```
<username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
```

**Components:**
- `<username>`: Your GitHub username (or `claude` for Claude Code)
- `<issue_num>`: The issue number (e.g., `7`, `42`)
- `<issue_slug>`: A short, kebab-case description derived from the issue title

**Examples:**
- `alice/7-add-user-authentication`
- `bob/42-fix-database-connection`
- `claude/15-update-documentation`

### Creating Branches

#### Option 1: Manual Branch Creation

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>

# Example
git checkout -b alice/7-add-user-authentication

# Push the branch to remote
git push -u origin <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
```

#### Option 2: Claude Code GitHub Actions

Claude Code can automatically create branches when you mention `@claude` in an issue comment:

```markdown
@claude can you start on this?
```

**What Claude Code Does:**
1. Creates a branch following the naming convention
2. Checks out the branch in the workflow environment
3. Can make initial commits if requested
4. Provides a link to create a PR when work is complete

**Claude Code Branch Format:**
When Claude creates branches, it uses:
```
claude/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
```

---

## Step 3: Development

Make your changes on the issue branch, following the project's coding conventions.

### Commit Guidelines

This project uses **Conventional Emoji Commits**. See [git-scm-conventions.md](./git-scm-conventions.md) for full details.

**Commit Format:**
```
<emoji> <type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common Types:**
- `‚ú® feat` - New feature
- `ü©π fix` - Bug fix
- `üìö docs` - Documentation
- `‚ôªÔ∏è refactor` - Code refactoring
- `üß™ test` - Tests
- `üîß build` - Build system changes

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "‚ú® feat(auth): add JWT authentication"
git commit -m "ü©π fix: resolve database connection timeout"
git commit -m "üìö docs: update API documentation"
```

### Making Changes

```bash
# Make your code changes
# ...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "‚ú® feat: add user authentication endpoints"

# Push to remote
git push origin <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
```

---

## Step 4: Pull Request

When your changes are ready, create a pull request.

### Creating a PR

#### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click "Pull requests" ‚Üí "New pull request"
3. Select your branch as the compare branch
4. Fill in the PR template (if available)
5. Click "Create pull request"

#### Option 2: GitHub CLI

```bash
gh pr create --title "‚ú® feat: add user authentication" \
  --body "Fixes #7

## Summary
- Implemented JWT authentication
- Added login and registration endpoints
- Added authentication middleware

## Test Plan
- [x] Manual testing of login flow
- [x] Manual testing of registration
- [x] Verified protected routes require auth"
```

#### Option 3: Claude Code Generated Link

When Claude Code completes work, it provides a pre-filled PR creation link:

```markdown
[Create PR ‚Üí](https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/main...branch?quick_pull=1&title=...&body=...)
```

### PR Best Practices

**Title Format:**
Follow the same conventional commit format:
```
<emoji> <type>[scope]: <description>
```

**PR Description Should Include:**
- **Summary**: What changes were made
- **Related Issues**: Use keywords to link issues (see below)
- **Test Plan**: How the changes were tested
- **Screenshots**: If UI changes are involved
- **Breaking Changes**: If applicable

### Linking PRs to Issues

Use GitHub keywords in your PR description to automatically close issues when the PR is merged:

**Keywords:**
- `Fixes #7`
- `Closes #7`
- `Resolves #7`

**Example PR Description:**
```markdown
## Summary
Implements user authentication using JWT tokens.

## Changes
- Added login endpoint at `/api/auth/login`
- Added registration endpoint at `/api/auth/register`
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Added authentication middleware for protected routes

## Related Issues
Fixes #7

## Test Plan
- [x] Tested login with valid credentials
- [x] Tested login with invalid credentials
- [x] Tested registration with new user
- [x] Verified JWT token validation
- [x] Verified protected routes require authentication

## Step 5: Review & Merge

### Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: Ensure CI/CD pipelines pass
2. **Peer Review**: Request reviews from team members
3. **Address Feedback**: Make requested changes and push updates
4. **Approval**: Obtain required approvals
5. **Merge**: Merge the PR using the appropriate strategy

### Merge Strategies

- **Squash and merge** (recommended): Combines all commits into one
- **Rebase and merge**: Maintains individual commits
- **Merge commit**: Creates a merge commit

### After Merging

1. **Issue Closure**: If you used `Fixes #N`, the issue closes automatically
2. **Branch Cleanup**: Delete the merged branch (GitHub offers this option)
3. **Local Cleanup**: Update your local repository

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Delete local branch
git branch -d <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Branch Already Exists

If a branch already exists for an issue:

```bash
# Check out the existing branch
git checkout <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
```

### Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts:

```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <username>/<issue_num>-<issue_slug>
git merge main

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Stage resolved files
git add .

# Complete the merge
git commit
```

### CI/CD Failures

If automated checks fail:

1. Review the error messages in the GitHub Actions logs
2. Fix the issues locally
3. Commit and push the fixes
4. Wait for checks to run again
